This crate contains a parser for Bitcoin Payment Instructions.

It supports nearly all encodings which you might encounter in QR codes,
typed/pasted into a text box, or opened via a system URI handler.

Any missing Payment Instruction formats should be added as soon as there is a
standard encoding for address formats, ideally using a Rust crate that (a) has
very minimal dependencies, (b) has a fairly conservative MSRV policy, and
(c) has regular contribution from more than one individual.
